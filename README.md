# Introduction

This repository holds a network topology about **backcountry ski routes of the Alps**. Each region consists of two **geojson** files:
1. Segments: A collection of LineString features with a segment id.
2. Compositions: A collection of routes with attributes and a list of segment id's.

Goals:
* Complete set of ski routes throughout the whole Alps.
* High quality standards.
* Compliance with the requirements of nature conservation.
* OpenData (Medium Term Goal)

# Tools
In order to edit ski routes within a network topology, two tools were developped:
1. [Routes Composer](https://github.com/UlysselaGlisse/RoutesComposer): A qGis plugin to edit routes within a network topology.
2. [SAC Route Network Editor](https://github.com/andreglauser/sac-route-network-editor/): A SQL based method to edit routes within a network topology.
