# Introduction

This readme is also in [:fr:](https://github.com/skitourenguru/Routes/blob/main/README.md)

In this repository, you will find skitouring routes drawn by the Petzl Foundation in collaboration with Skitourenguru Gmbh.
For now, only French routes are present. In the future, all Alpine routes should be included.

These routes have not yet received their final treatment. Do not use them under any circumstances. If you wish to obtain them, send an email to
randohiver@fondation-petzl.org, or go [here](https://download.skitourenguru.com/public/France-Ski.zip).

For the creation of these routes, a method has been developed which you will find detailed in the project's [wiki](https://github.com/skitourenguru/Routes/wiki/Home-en).
